## Hello, I'm pvini07BR.
...or you can just call me pvini. I'm a coding hobbyist from Brazil that enjoys coding and experimenting with project ideas that I find interesting. Most of them are game development related, but I also like to explore and learn more about programming in general, such as game engine development, low level programming, networking, maybe even web development if it is somehow related with games or some fun idea. And also, I learn by doing instead of spending hours watching tutorials or reading documentation. If I have a cool project idea on mind, I will try to execute it even if I don't have the needed skills or knowledge for it. I will learn on my way! And of course, with no pressure.

I've tried lots of different languages, but I developed more proficiency on languages like C and C++, and also Godot Engine. I like the simplicity of the C language, but I'm also open to experimenting with other low level languages like Rust, Zig, Odin and others.

Unfortunately, most of my projects here on GitHub are not finished, but I can still list the interesting project ideas that I'm currently working on, or will still work on.
