## Hello, I'm pvini07BR.
...or you can just call me pvini. I'm a hobbyist coder from Brazil that enjoys coding and experimenting with project ideas that I find interesting. Most of them are game development related, but I also like to explore and learn more about programming in general, such as GPU programming, shaders, low level langauges, networking, maybe even web development if it is somehow related with games or some fun idea. And also, I learn by doing instead of spending hours watching tutorials or reading documentation. If I have a cool project idea on mind, I will try to execute it even if I don't have the needed skills or knowledge for it. I will learn on my way! And of course, with no pressure.

Unfortunately, most of my projects here on GitHub are not finished, but I can still list the interesting project ideas that I'm currently working on, or will still work on.

If you need to reach or contact me, or ask me a question, feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://x.com/pvini07BR) or DM me on Discord (pvini07BR).
