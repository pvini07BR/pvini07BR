# Hello, I'm pvini07BR.
...or you can just call me pvini.

- I'm a coding hobbyist from Brazil that enjoys coding and experimenting with project ideas that I find interesting.
- Most of the projects and stuff I do are game development related, but I like to tinker with other stuff as well.
- I've tried several different languages and engines, but I am most experienced in using **Godot Engine**, and low level languages like **C**, **C++** and **Rust**, but I also like to tinker with other niche languages like **Zig**, **Odin**, etc.

Unfortunately, most of my projects here on GitHub are not finished or just prototypes, but I can still list the interesting project ideas that I'm currently working on.

## My Projects
Each entry will present a link to the repo of the project with a brief description, mostly with an README that explains more about the project.

- [VIRUS HAVOC (Prototype)](https://github.com/pvini07BR/virus-havoc-prototype): An game about a 2D space shooter where you fight against malwares on the internet. It's my dream game project, and has been in development in quite a long time. It will require more than just coding to finish it.

- [squarebox](https://github.com/pvini07BR/squarebox): A 2D minecraft clone written in C, with the goal of being a clone more focused on creativity and being a sandbox. You can click on the link to read the README and see more about the game.

- [3DSky](https://github.com/pvini07BR/3dsky): An Bluesky client for the Nintendo 3DS. It's my repo with the most stars, and I'm proud of it.

Any other repos on my profile are either reattempts of an project idea, or experimenting with an idea.

I also plan on making a proper portfolio website, specially if I manage to get lots of finished projects, someday, I hope.

## Contact
If you liked any of my projects, and would like to see it grow, or help and contribute to it, feel free to do so! My dream is to make coding projects that people will enjoy, and build something great together.
